                                <p>The Centre for Functional Materials (CFM) (Formerly Centre for Crystal Growth - CCG) at VIT, Vellore was established in December 2016. Functional materials are materials which exhibit responses against external output and it covers different material classes ranging from semiconductors to polymers and molecular crystals to nanoparticles.

                                  Our research focuses mainly on the crystal growth, thin film fabrications, nanomaterials, ceramics, biomaterials, polymers, laser shock wave processing, metals, magnetic materials and optical materials.
                                  
                                  CFM has also been active in providing various material characterization facilities like Z-scan, laser damage threshold, optical studies, micro hardness measurement, dielectric analysis - LCR meter and surface etching studies, photoconductivity and refractive index measurements. The centre gains attention due to its immense publication in the diverse field of research in the functional materials. We create ultimately materials that can be utilized for various electronic and multifunctional devices.
                                  
                                  CFM has ten core faculty and more than 45 research scholars and project associates. The Centre faculty are actively engaged in teaching various courses in "M. Sc., Physics" and undertaking research projects for M.Sc., and Ph. D. Scholars."</P>
